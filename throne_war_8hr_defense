<size=50><b><color=teal>Cross Server Invasion (Throne War)</color></b></size>

CSI will be happening at reset! In this event 3 servers will compete to control their thrones and the thrones of other servers. It is critical for all players on our server, not just the throne holder, to control their throne. This allows the "King" to grant server wide buffs, provide reward packs, and help maintain order on the server.

<size=45><b><color=teal>How does it work?</color></b></size>

In the center of the map, known as the "Scorched Lands", there are 5 structures. 4 sentries, and 1 throne. These are the special rules for the structures and the Scorched Lands.

<size=40><b><color=#e2b13c>Sentry Towers</color></b></size>
- If a Sentry Tower is <color=#F00>occupied</color> by an alliance other than the throne occupier, it will attack the Throne every <color=#F00>5 minutes</color> providing <color=#F00>-2% power to EVERY unit in the Throne</color>.
- Occupying towers <color=#F00>DOES NOT</color> affect the battle for the Throne in any other way.

<size=40><b><color=#e2b13c>Throne</color></b></size>
- This is the primary objective of Throne war.
- An alliance may claim a throne by either:
-- Occupying the throne for<color=#F00> 8 hours continuously</color>.
-- Or having the highest total occupation time over the 24hr event.
- Only after a server gains control of their Throne, can they gain control of another throne.
- If a server occupies multiple thrones simultaneously, the occupiers home server gains "Invasion Protection" protecting their Throne from invasion by another server.
- When a server recaptures a throne from another server, the Throne gains "Capture Protection" for 30 minutes. During this time players from another server can not attack the throne.
- At the end of the event, the alliance who has successfully claimed the Throne may appoint a "King from their alliance.
- If multiple thrones are captured by a single server, the King gains access to more rewards to distribute.
- If a server does not defend their throne, the server loses it's King, and is unable to benefit from the King's perks.

<size=40><b><color=#e2b13c>Scorched Lands</color></b></size>
- Players in the Scorched Lands cannot activate shields, and will lose any shield upon entering.
- Castles in the Scorched Land will be "Knocked Out" after a sing defeat.


<size=45><b><color=teal>Strategy</color></b></size>
<color=#F00>Our overall strategy</color> for this CSI is to hold OUR Throne for <color=#F00>8hrs continuously</color> <color=#F00>at the start </color>of the event, and focus primarily on defense, letting other servers burn their Heals at a 2:1 ratio of us. We will focus on points and leader board AFTER we guarantee control of our Throne (Either 8 hrs continuously or 12hrs total.) This is a <color=#F00>SERVER WIDE EFFORT</color>, please support the <color=#F00>group before</color> seeking <color=#F00>individual</color> rewards.

Periodically we will send "Raids" to other Servers to reset their timers.

☆ First and foremost: <i><b><color=#F00>listen to calls by your Officers</color></b></i>.
☆ We will be re-tagging our alliances as 333A-333_, based on alliance power ranking to avoid any confusion.
☆ <i><b><color=#F00>DO NOT ATTACK ANYONE ON OUR SERVER!</color></b></i> It gives you no points and actively works against us.
☆ If you are not ANR: <i><b><color=#F00>DO NOT OCCUPY A SENTRY</color></b></i>
☆ <color=#F00>1 hour prior to reset</color>: Players with <color=#F00>power over 20B</color> teleport into the Scorched lands, and surround the throne. Pack in as closely as possible.
☆ <color=#00F>30 minutes prior to reset</color>: Players with power <color=#00F>greater than 5B</color> pack in around the center group of players.
☆ <color=#0F0>All other players</color>: Teleport into safe zones near the Scorched Lands and reinforce the players of the innermost ring. Leave 2 Troops in reserve.
☆ <color=#F00>ANR's role</color> in the first stages of CSI will be to hold and <color=#F00>defend the server's home Throne</color>. As such, if an ANR member asks you to move your castle so they may TP into that slot, please let them.
☆ At reset: ANR will take and hold the Throne with their strongest Troop.
☆ When a <color=#F00>player from another server</color> comes to our server:
☆☆ Make a <color=#F00>call out</color> in Alliance AND Kingdom chat with <color=#F00>their power</color>.
☆☆ <color=#0F0>Players in the safe zones</color>: Start Rallies if they are less than 5 minutes from you.
☆☆ <color=#F00>Players in Scorched Lands</color>: Only attack if they are less than 1:30 away from you. Do not TP and break castle formation. Always keep 2 marches or more at home.
☆ If <color=#F00>our Throne is under attack</color> by another Server:
☆☆ <color=#F00>ANR: Continuously "Reinforce"</color> the Throne and heal units at your base. This will reduce the amount of scrolls used, and create a power mismatch with the attackers.
☆☆ <color=#00F>Others: Attempt to destroy invaders castles.</color> If the castle is destroyed, attacking troops are sent home.
☆ Periodically <color=#F00>Raids will be called</color> for on a particular server at a particular time.
☆☆ At the designated time: All available players not in ANR will <color=#F00>teleport to the designated server</color> through the <color=#F00>event menu under the "Horn Icon"</color>.
☆☆ <color=#F00>All players will send their largest Troop(s) at the throne</color>. Leaving in reserve some troops to prevent a free "Knock Out".
☆☆ Alliance Officers may call out for other objectives in this time. Watch alliance and Kingdom chat for instructions.
☆☆ When the timer is reset, recall and retreat to our server to begin defense again.
☆ If a <color=#F00>castle in our formation is destroyed, IMMEDIATELY station troops </color>on that location to prevent an enemy server from teleporting there.
<size=50><b><i><color=#F00>☆ After we secure our throne, we will attempt to deploy en masse to another server to take theirs. This is where we will earn our points.</color></i></b></size>

<size=45><b><color=teal>How reinforcement work</color></b></size>

<color=#F00>When you reinforce the Throne, everyone gets the same power bonus as the biggest troops</color>. Similarly, when you reinforce a castle, you may also get some power bonus. So, if you are small, do as much reinforcement as you can. But if you are big, do as little as possible.

<size=45><b><color=teal>General Tips</color></b></size>

- <color=#F00>Use Troop Leaders that have high movement speed and recovery speed bonuses.</color> (Anko, Erika, Ptolemy, Filius, Daisy, Gruen)
- When possible fight an objective or  defend. These are the most efficient ways to get points, preserve heals, and maintain control of an area.
- Reinforce your Alliance's castles in our center formation as much as possible.
- Remember, <i><b><color=#F00>even small players can neutralize large players</color></b></i> by attacking them as a group and preventing them from healing or sending out troops while waiting for reinforcements.
- We may call for a change of strategy at some point. Please watch all communication channels for updates!
